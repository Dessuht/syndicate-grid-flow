## 1. Game Flow: The Day Cycle

The game progresses through a four-phase daily cycle, which dictates when certain actions and events occur.

| Phase | Action Window | Core Mechanics Processed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Morning** | **Officer Assignment & Interaction** | Officers can be assigned to buildings. Player interactions (Share Tea, Give Bonus, Reprimand) are available. |
| **Day** | **Operations** | Buildings generate **Cash** and **Heat**. Officer energy is consumed. Police Shakedown events may trigger. |
| **Evening** | **Soldier Needs & Stipends** | **Cash** is spent on soldier stipends. Soldier needs (Food, Entertainment) are met by building output, affecting **Loyalty**. Desertion checks occur. |
| **Night** | **Events & Recovery** | Random events (Betrayal, Rival Attack, Criminal Caught) and the **Coup Attempt** check occur. Wounded officers recover 1 day. |

The **Family Council** is triggered automatically at the start of the Morning phase every 10 days.

## 2. Core Resources

Managing these five resources is central to the game:

| Resource | Icon | Primary Use | Key Generation/Loss |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cash** | $ | Recruiting, Bribes, Bonuses, Healing. | Generated by buildings during the Day phase. |
| **Reputation** | ⭐ | Affects event outcomes and diplomatic standing. | Gained/Lost through conflict resolution and officer interactions. |
| **Police Heat** | ⚠️ | Triggers Police Raids (high) and Shakedowns (medium). | Generated by buildings (especially illicit ones). Reduced by White Paper Fan officers or bribes. |
| **Intel** | 🧠 | Used for diplomacy, scouting rivals, and releasing arrested officers. | Gained from certain officer traits (Street Smart) or purchased for $500. |
| **Influence** | ⚡ | Used in the Family Council to order votes or mediate internal conflicts. | Gained by achieving consensus in the Family Council. |

## 3. Officer Management

Officers are the backbone of your operation. Their skills, loyalty, and status directly impact your success.

### Ranks and Specialties

Officers are categorized by traditional Triad ranks, each granting a specialty skill bonus:

| Rank | Specialty | Primary Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Red Pole** | Enforcement | Boosts illicit revenue, improves combat defense. |
| **White Paper Fan**| Diplomacy | Reduces police heat generation, improves bribe costs. |
| **Straw Sandal** | Logistics | Boosts legal revenue. |
| **Blue Lantern** | Recruitment | Boosts soldier loyalty. |

### Officer Status

| Status | Effect | Resolution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Wounded** | Cannot be assigned. Recovers 1 day per cycle. | Instant heal for **$2,000** (Private Clinic). |
| **Arrested** | Cannot be assigned. | Release for **$5,000** or **50 Intel** (Bribe Official). |
| **Testing Waters**| Loyalty decays by -5% per day. | Cleared upon successful completion of any assigned operation. |
| **Grudge** | Officer holds a deep resentment, often due to being overruled in the Council or punished. | Increases risk of betrayal. |

### Officer Interactions (Morning Phase Only)

| Action | Cost | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Share Tea** | -10 Energy | +5 Loyalty, reveals officer's current agenda/desire. |
| **Give Bonus** | -$1,000 | +20 Loyalty, clears ambition/promotion agendas. |
| **Reprimand** | None | -10 Heat, -20 Loyalty (Risk of Snitching/Quitting if loyalty drops below 20). |
| **Promote** | -$5,000, 50 Face | Promotes officer to Deputy (438) or Dragonhead (489). Resets Face, boosts skills/loyalty/max energy. |
| **Designate Successor** | None | Designates the officer who will take over if the current leader dies. |

## 4. Conflict and Events

Events interrupt the normal flow and require immediate player choice.

### Internal Conflicts

| Event | Trigger | Consequences | Resolution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Daily Briefing** | Randomly at Night (for next Morning). | Officer effectiveness reduced by 50% if ignored. | Financial payment (cost varies) or Authoritarian command (-20 Loyalty). |
| **Betrayal** | Officer Loyalty < 40 and high idle time. | Officer plots against you. | Forgive (+20 Loyalty, -10 Rep), Punish (-30 Loyalty, +5 Heat), or Exile (officer removed). |
| **Street Beef** | Two assigned officers have incompatible traits for 3 consecutive days. | 15% revenue reduction until resolved. | Mediate (-5 Influence, +5 Loyalty to both), Council (formal judgment), or Fire (remove one officer). |
| **Coup Attempt** | High-ranking officer Loyalty < 15 and Face > 50. | Officer seizes a building and 30% of your soldiers. | **Raid** (combat resolution) or **Negotiate** (-$5k, -50 Intel, -50 Rep, officer returns). |
| **New Era** | Current leader dies (not implemented yet, but logic exists). | Successor takes over. All remaining officers enter "Testing the Waters" status (-30 Loyalty shock). | Acknowledge and continue. |

### External Conflicts

| Event | Trigger | Consequences | Resolution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Police Raid** | Police Heat > 70. | Major police action against your operations. | Bribe, Stand Ground (combat check), or Scatter & Escape (building closure). |
| **Police Shakedown** | Police Heat > 50 during Day operations. | Local police demand a bribe at an occupied building. | Bribe (cost based on Heat), Lay Low (building closed 2 days), or Resist (50% chance officer is arrested). |
| **Rival Attack** | Rival Relationship < -30. | Rival gang attacks your territory. | Fight Back (combat check), Pay Tribute (-$800), or Strategic Retreat (building closure, -10 Rep). |
| **Street War** | Rival conflict status is active. | Full-scale war with a rival gang. | Bribe (high cost) or Fight Back (major combat check, risk of losing profitable building). |

## 5. Diplomacy and Territory

The Global Map view allows you to manage relations with rival gangs and expand your influence.

### Rival Gangs

Rival gangs have a **Strength** rating (combat power) and a **Relationship** score (-100 to 100).

| Action | Cost | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Buy Intel** | -$500 | Gain 50 Intel. |
| **Scout Territory** | -50 Intel | Reveals the rival's exact Strength rating. |
| **Reduce Friction** | -20 Intel | Improves Relationship by +10. |
| **Trade Agreement** | -$1,000 | Improves Relationship by +10, grants trade benefits (future implementation). |
| **Alliance** | Requires +30 Relationship | Improves Relationship by +20, forms a defense pact. |
| **Turf War** | None | Initiates an active conflict, severely lowering Relationship. |

### Family Council

The Council is a formal meeting where the top officers vote on major motions (e.g., expansion, internal policy).

*   **Voting:** Officers vote based on their loyalty and rank. The player's vote breaks ties.
*   **Influence:** You can spend **10 Influence** to force a specific officer's vote, preventing them from gaining a grudge if they disagree with the final outcome.
*   **Resolution:** If the motion passes (or is vetoed by the player), the effects are applied, and the Council adjourns.

## 6. Buildings and Revenue

Your territory's income comes from buildings. Assigning officers to them is crucial for maximizing revenue and managing heat.

| Building Type | Illicit? | Base Revenue | Heat Gen | Food | Entertainment | Officer Specialty Bonus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Noodle Shop** | No | $500 | +1 | +30 | +5 | Straw Sandal |
| **Mahjong Parlor** | Yes | $800 | +3 | 0 | +40 | Red Pole |
| **Warehouse** | No | $400 | +2 | 0 | 0 | Straw Sandal |
| **Nightclub** | Yes | $600 | +4 | +10 | +60 | Red Pole |
| **Counterfeit Lab** | Yes | $1000 | +5 | 0 | 0 | Red Pole |
| **Police Station** | No | $0 | -15 | 0 | 0 | White Paper Fan |
| **Drug Lab** | Yes | $1200 | +6 | 0 | 0 | Red Pole |

*   **Illicit Buildings:** Generate more heat but provide higher revenue. Red Pole officers boost their output.
*   **Legal Buildings:** Generate less heat. Straw Sandal officers boost their output.
*   **Police Station:** Assigning a White Paper Fan here significantly reduces heat.
*   **Food/Entertainment:** These outputs help satisfy your soldiers' needs in the Evening phase.

## 7. Soldiers and Loyalty

Soldiers are your workforce and muscle. Their loyalty is crucial for preventing desertion and ensuring combat effectiveness.

### Soldier Needs (Evening Phase)

Each soldier has three needs that decay daily:

1.  **Food:** Satisfied by buildings with Food output.
2.  **Entertainment:** Satisfied by buildings with Entertainment output.
3.  **Pay:** Satisfaction depends on the daily stipend you set.

*   **Stipend:** A daily cost per soldier. Higher stipends improve Pay satisfaction.
*   **Loyalty:** Calculated based on average satisfaction of all three needs. Low loyalty (< 20) causes desertion.
*   **Desertion:** If loyalty drops too low, soldiers will leave, reducing your forces.

### Soldier Interactions

*   **Recruit Soldier:** Costs **$500**.
*   **Set Stipend:** Adjust the daily pay per soldier ($0 - $200).
*   **Heal Soldier:** Not directly possible; wounded officers (from combat events) must be healed.

## 8. Game Over Conditions

The game can end under the following circumstances:

1.  **Leader Death without Successor:** If your current leader (Dragonhead) dies and you have not designated a successor, the syndicate collapses. This is a total game over.
2.  **Failed Coup Negotiation:** If you attempt to negotiate with a coup leader but lack the required cash or intel, the coup remains active, and you cannot proceed normally.
3.  **Bankruptcy:** While not explicitly coded as a loss condition, running out of cash can make it impossible to pay stipends, bribe police, or respond to events, leading to a downward spiral.

## 9. Tips for Success

*   **Balance Heat:** Keep police heat manageable to avoid frequent raids. Use White Paper Fans and the Police Station.
*   **Manage Officer Loyalty:** Regular interactions prevent betrayals and coups. Watch for grudges.
*   **Meet Soldier Needs:** Set a reasonable stipend and assign officers to provide Food and Entertainment to prevent desertion.
*   **Strategic Diplomacy:** Scout rivals, reduce friction, and consider forming alliances to avoid constant conflict.
*   **Plan for the Council:** Use Influence wisely to guide votes and avoid creating grudges among your officers.
